			We held the first Svelte conference on April 26, 2019. It gathered over 1000 highly
			enthusiastic developers from across the globe. Since then, we've hosted and organised nine
			more events. Each time, the number of attendees dramatically increases. In contrast to most
			other events we take pride in keeping it joyfli and fun, much like how people feel when they
			decide to use Svelte.

			Svelte is growing like crazy. Numbers are up manyfold on the Community discord, Reddit as well
			as on a number of other platforms. Developers love Svelte. So much so that they quit their
			jobs if they find a new one where they can use it. As you can see in the screenshots below,
			Svelte topped the charts for most exciting and most loved framework in a couple of surveys
			this year.
